[15-445](https://15445.courses.cs.cmu.edu/fall2022/) is the intro to database management system course at CMU. It is a very popular course, and I've heard people recommend it many times. The best part of it is that most course resources: lecture videos, slides, homework, and even auto-grader is available for the public. I've been working on the fall 2022 version since July and now I'm half way through it.

Overall it's a good course, but it may not be the one you expected. In UCSD, CSE 132A is the intro to database course, which focuses more on SQL and database schema design. 15-445 is more about the implementations and optimizations of a database system, which is more like a systems course. It's better to take 15-445 with some prior operating system knowledge.

The projects are amazing. I've done project 0 and 1, currently working on project 2. If you want to do C++, you shouldn't miss it. I'll write a series of post about the projects later on.

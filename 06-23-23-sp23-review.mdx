Spring 2023 has came to an end. I have taken 4 courses this quarter. Here is a review of them.

- [CSE 105: Theory of Computability](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse105)
  This is a major requirement for CS26. The course focuses on the theory of computability and is quite theoretical in nature. Professor Mia Minnes is very approachable, and the course material is intriguing. Topics covered include Turing Machines, Regular Languages, Context-Free Languages, and more. Although the course is not overly time-consuming, you do need to invest time to grasp the concepts. On average, it took us 5 hours per week to complete the homework.
- [CSE 120: Principles of Computer Operating Systems](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse120)
  This course delves into the basic concepts of operating systems, covering topics such as processes, threads, synchronization, memory management, and file systems. The course is demanding in terms of time and the programming assignments (PAs) require substantial debugging. Nevertheless, it's worth taking, as operating systems are a crucial subject in computer science and are essential for backend development.
- [CSE 135: Server-side Web Applications](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse135)
  This course is centered around server-side web applications. However, students are expected to learn specific technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and MongoDB independently. The lectures primarily discuss broader concepts in web development. If I were already familiar with web development, I would have found this course quite engaging. You'll build an analytics app similar to Google Analytics for the project. While the course itself might not be resume-worthy, it is nevertheless informative. Exam preparation involves memorizing slides, which isn't particularly difficult but is time-consuming.
- [CSE 150B: AI: Search and Reasoning](https://catalog.ucsd.edu/courses/CSE.html#cse150b)
  The material is challenging, but the homework assignments are relatively straightforward. The course involves building AI models for games. Even if you're not particularly interested in AI, you can still earn a good grade. However, the final exam is difficult.

I received three A+ grades and one A this quarter.

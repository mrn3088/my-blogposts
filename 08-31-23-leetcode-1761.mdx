Today's LeetCode daily challenge in (leetcode.cn)[leetcode.cn] is an interesting one.

It worth to notice that `2 <= n <= 400`, so we can use n^3 time complexity algorithm to solve it.  
The idea would be: 
- enumerate all possible tuples (i, j, k) where i, j, k are different vertices, check whether they form a connected trio, and update the minimum degree.
- To enumerate we must need `n^3` time, while to check for connected trio we only need constant time if built an Adjacency Matrix.  

So without too much doubt I submitted my version one...and got an TLE :(

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<unordered_set<int>> graph(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0] - 1].insert(edge[1] - 1);
            graph[edge[1] - 1].insert(edge[0] - 1);
        }
        size_t res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (const auto j : graph[i]) {
                for (const auto k : graph[j]) {
                    if (i != k && graph[i].count(k)) {
                        res = min(res, graph[i].size() + graph[j].size() + graph[k].size() - 6);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
    }
};
```

Let's take a look at the time complexity of this algorithm. 

- The first for loop is `O(n)`, the second for loop is `O(n)`, the third for loop is `O(n)`, and the `count` operation is `O(1)`. So the total time complexity is `O(n^3)`. Sounds good, right?

However, when `n <= 400`,  n^3 could reach 64,000,000, which is at the edge of the time limit. Remember, number of operations for C++ is at maximum around 1^8 in algorithmic problems. So we need to be careful for this number. 

In the worse case, each of the three for loop will iterate `n - 1` times. Besides, iterating through an `unordered_map` is depending on the number of buckets, not number of elements. So we can optimize it through the following: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<unordered_set<int>> graph(n);
        for (const auto& edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0] - 1].insert(edge[1] - 1);
            graph[edge[1] - 1].insert(edge[0] - 1);
        }
        size_t res = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (!graph[i].count(j)) continue;
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                    if (graph[i].count(k) && graph[j].count(k)) {
                        res = min(res, graph[i].size() + graph[j].size() + graph[k].size() - 6);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return res == INT_MAX ? -1 : res;
    }
};
```

Now, even though the asymptotic complexity is still `n^3`, we indeed decreased number of operations. Thus passed the last test case.

Notice that the `unordered_map` is could also be optimized so that we can guarantee a O(1) lookup: 

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minTrioDegree(int n, vector<vector<int>>& edges) {
        vector<vector<int>> d(n, vector<int>(n));
        vector<int> deg(n);
        for (auto &e : edges) {
            d[e[0] - 1][e[1] - 1] = d[e[1] - 1][e[0] - 1] = true;
            deg[e[0] - 1]++;
            deg[e[1] - 1]++;
        }
        int ans = INT_MAX;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; ++j) {
                if (!d[i][j])
                    continue;
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; ++k) {
                    if (d[i][k] && d[j][k]) 
                        ans = min(ans, deg[i] + deg[j] + deg[k] - 6);
                }
            }
        return ans == INT_MAX ? -1 : ans;
    }
};

```
